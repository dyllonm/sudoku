# Sudoku

This is a simple Sudoku game written in Node.

## Purpose

I have written this as a project to work on as I learn Node. I plan on expanding on it in the future by adding more features as I continue to learn Node and other technologies.

## Features

* Generates a sudoku board that is (hopefully) solveable without guessing.
* Informs the player of mistakes.
* Informs the player when the game is solved.
* Includes a button to generate a new game and start over.
* Includes a button to Solve the current puzzle.
